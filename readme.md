# What is this project for

- Learning NodeJS, entry in backend development

# Note

- Everything done here is made by my own with research, but no single line is copy paste.

# What is used so far

- File System package
  -> to have acces to local files
- http package
  -> to create localServer
- url package
  -> to parse URL

- .prettierrc
  -> preparation for "real" scenario, if everyone should use the same prettier settings

- nodemon
  -> to not start and reload server with every change manually

- dynamic fileSystem Variable "`${__dirname}`"
  -> to be more flexible with filelocations

## Progress

with tools used above:

- Created localhost Server on Port 8000
- Created async Routing
- Created fallback if Route doesnt exists
- Server Listener which reacts to every change made
